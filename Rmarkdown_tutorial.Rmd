# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



### Linear regression analysis
#### Linear Model Creation: 
lm() is the function used to fit linear models in R.
dist ~ speed specifies the model formula, where dist is the dependent variable (response) and speed is the independent variable (predictor).
data = cars indicates that the data to be used is from the cars dataset, which is a built-in dataset in R containing data on the speed of cars and the corresponding stopping distances.
#### Extract Coefficients: 
coef(fit) extracts the coefficients from the fitted model fit.
The result b will contain two coefficients: the intercept and the slope of the regression line. 
b[1] is the intercept, and b[2] is the slope of the line.
#### Plot the Data:
plot(cars) creates a scatter plot of the cars dataset, with speed on the x-axis and dist on the y-axis.
This plot visualizes the relationship between car speed and stopping distance.
#### Add Regression Line:
abline(fit) adds the regression line to the existing plot.
This line represents the linear model that was fitted to the data, showing the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between observed and predicted stopping distances.


```{r}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) # lm() is the function used to fit linear models in R.
b = coef(fit) # coef(fit) extracts the coefficients from the fitted model fit.
plot(cars) # plot(cars) creates a scatter plot of the cars dataset, with speed on the x-axis and dist on the y-axis.
abline(fit) # abline(fit) adds the regression line to the existing plot.
```

# HTML
This is a level 1 heading (H1) in your RMarkdown document. The `#` symbol indicates the highest level of heading. In the context of your document:

- **HTML** is the main section or chapter.
- In the output HTML file, this will be styled as a large, prominent heading.

## toc
This is a level 2 heading (H2). The `##` symbol creates a subheading under the main section. 

- **toc** stands for "table of contents." In this context, it usually refers to settings related to the table of contents in your document.
- The heading `toc` might be used to group settings or explanations related to the table of contents.

### toc_depth
This is a level 3 heading (H3). The `###` symbol creates a subheading under the `toc` section.

- **toc_depth** specifies how many levels of headings should be included in the table of contents. For example, setting `toc_depth: 2` will include only `#` and `##` level headings in the TOC.
- If you want all headings (from `#` to `####`) to appear in the TOC, you set `toc_depth: 4`.

#### toc_float
This is a level 4 heading (H4). The `####` symbol creates a subheading under the `toc_depth` section.

- **toc_float** is a setting that, when enabled, allows the table of contents to "float" or remain visible as you scroll down the document.
- Setting `toc_float: true` makes the TOC panel stay in view, which is useful for navigating long documents.

```


#Commonly Used Option Definitions

eval: Evaluation of a code snippet

```{r}
do_it = Sys.Date() '2024-08-09'
```

```{r, eval= do_it}

- `collapse`: Decides whether to combine the text output and source code into a single code block in the output.
- `error`, `message`, `warning`: Controls whether to print errors, messages, or warnings.
- `include`: When set to FALSE for `echo`, `results`, `warning`, `message`, it means none of these options will be applied.
